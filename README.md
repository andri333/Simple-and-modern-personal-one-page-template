# simplepage
A really simple and fast page for freelancers who don't know which website they are looking for...


-------------------About the project:

-Really easy page for creative freelancers

-Easy to install and manage - it only contains one file - index.html (all styling is right inside it!)

-Naturally a onepage theme, but since it's HTML and CSS, everything is customizable.

-Go grazy with it, since it's GNU license.

-Took a few minutes to build that simple template.

-I hope it helps someone.


-------------------How to install:

-Upload the index.html file to your desired directory

-Access it by going to yoursite.com/index.html


-------------------How to perform basic changes:

-To change the backround, simply change the image url that is: <body background="RIGHT HERE!!!">

-To change any texts you see on the page, simply copy it on the live site and once you're editing index.html file, use Ctrl+C to find the same sentence in the code - and change it. Just be sure not to remove any "" symbols.
